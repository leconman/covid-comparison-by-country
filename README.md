# COVID Comparison by Country

This project explores and tracks COVID vaccination information globally and by country, looking to answer the following questions:

* How are COVID vaccination efforts performing globally?
* Which countries are performing the best and worst in terms of vaccination efforts?
* What other factors of a country's performance are closely related to their rate of vaccination?

Data was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations "Covid Vaccinations") with COVID vaccination, case, and death counts current as of 1/30/23. SQL in a Google BigQuery environment was used to explore and wrangle the over 200,000 records of data before being brought into Tableau for further analysis and visualization. 

The end result is a Tableau dashboard, linked [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/connor.courtien/viz/COVIDComparisonbyCountry/COVIDVaccinationTracker "Dashboard"), with visualizations and statistics that explore and answer the above questions.
